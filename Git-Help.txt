1. 'git init': Initializes a new Git repository in your project directory. You'll run this command once at the beginning of your project.

2. 'git clone <repository-url>`: Downloads an existing Git repository from a remote server (like GitHub) to your local machine. Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your UE5 project repository.

3. 'git status': Shows the current status of your working directory. It displays information about untracked files, modified files, and staged changes.

4. 'git add <file>': Stages changes for commit. Use this command to add specific files to the staging area.
 For example:
 
   ```
   git add MyLevel.umap
   
   ```

5. 'git commit -m "Your commit message here" ': Creates a new commit with the changes you've staged. Always include a descriptive commit message to explain what you've done.

6. `git pull`: Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local branch. Useful for keeping your local copy up to date with the latest changes.

7. `git push`: Sends your local commits to the remote repository. Use this to share your work with your team.

8. `git log`: Displays a history of commits. Useful for tracking changes and understanding the project's development timeline.

9. `git branch`: Lists all branches in your repository. You'll often use this to see which branch you're currently on.

10. `git checkout <branch-name>`: Switches to a different branch. 
For example, to switch to the `development` branch:

    ```
    git checkout development
    
    ```

11. `git merge <branch-name>`: Merges changes from one branch into another. Be cautious with this command, especially when dealing with feature branches.

12. `git stash`: Temporarily saves your changes without committing them. Useful when you need to switch branches but don't want to commit unfinished work.

13. `git remote -v`: Lists the remote repositories associated with your local repository. Verify that your UE5 project's remote (usually on GitHub) is correctly set up.

14. `git fetch`: Retrieves changes from the remote repository without merging them. Useful for checking if there are updates without automatically applying them.

15. `git reset --hard HEAD`: Discards all changes in your working directory and resets to the last committed state. Be cautious with thisâ€”it's irreversible!
